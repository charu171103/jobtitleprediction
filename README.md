*Job Title Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*

#Introduction
This project aims to predict job titles based on job descriptions using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The dataset used for training and testing the model is the "Data Science Job Postings on Glassdoor" dataset obtained from Kaggle.


#Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes related to job postings. The attributes used for this project are:

Job Title: The title of the job position.
Company Name: The name of the company offering the job.
Industry: The industry or sector to which the company belongs.
Job Description: A detailed description of the job responsibilities, requirements, and qualifications.
Before using the dataset, it's essential to preprocess it, handle missing values, and select relevant columns.


#Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Download the "Data Science Job Postings on Glassdoor" dataset from Kaggle and specify the file path in the code.
Install the required dependencies by running:
>> pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
Run the provided code in your Python environment. Make sure to adjust file paths if necessary.


#Preprocessing
Select relevant columns such as 'Job Title', 'Company Name', 'Industry', and 'Job Description'.
Drop rows with missing values in the selected columns.
Concatenate text columns to create input text for the model.


#Model Architecture
The RNN model architecture consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense output layer. It's designed to predict job titles based on input job descriptions.


#Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Tokenize and pad sequences of job descriptions.
Build and train the RNN model using the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data.


#Prediction
Provide a new job description for prediction.
Tokenize and pad the sequence of the new job description.
Use the trained model to predict the job title based on the provided description.
Display the predicted job title.


#Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use RNNs for job title prediction based on job descriptions. The model's accuracy and performance can be further improved by experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques.
